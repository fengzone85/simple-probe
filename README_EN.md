# Simple Probe · Self-hosted Docker Monitor (Nezha alternative)

> Repository: https://github.com/fengzone85/simple-probe

The agent runs as a **Docker container** on each monitored VPS. It **only makes outbound HTTPS reports** — no inbound ports are opened on the monitored host, and no remote-execution capability exists. Data flows only into **your own dedicated VPS**, where the server renders a polished dashboard and can push offline / threshold-exceeded alerts to a QQ Mail inbox or Telegram.

> Design goal: eliminate the class of vulnerabilities that plague Nezha (monitored hosts exposed to the public internet + remote execution → RCE). This design gives agents zero inbound surface, zero execution interfaces, and enforces auth + TLS end to end.

---

## Design principles (5)

This project trades "doing less" for "being safer". Five non-negotiable design principles:

1. **Trust isolation over feature richness** — neither the server nor any agent is assumed trustworthy; a breach of either must not spread to the other.
2. **No command channel** — Agent → Server is a one-way data flow; the server has no mechanism to influence agent behavior (no WebSocket downstream, no task push).
3. **Zero coupling between agents** — each agent knows only its own `SERVER_URL` + token; agents cannot perceive one another.
4. **Data minimization** — we collect only basic state (online / load / CPU / memory / disk / traffic / temperature / Swap / uptime) and never fingerprint the host (no kernel version, GPU, public IP, connection count, or process count).
5. **Server untrusted + credentials never naked** — HTTPS throughout, tokens stored as SHA-256 hashes, sessions via signed cookies, dangerous actions gated by TOTP; defense in depth, not single-point trust.

## Project advantages

This project earned a **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)** rating in two independent security / code reviews, with the verdict "safe for production use". Core strengths:

**🔒 Security-first architecture**
- **Zero inbound, zero remote-execution on agents**: eliminates the Nezha-class "monitored host exposed + remote exec → RCE" attack surface at the root; monitoring data only enters your own dedicated VPS.
- **Transport + implementation defense in depth**: HTTPS enforcement via whitelist (only `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` passes, default deny — no spoofed-header bypass), constant-time token comparison (no timing side-channel), and a strict CSP (no `unsafe-inline`, no external scripts).

**🛡️ Layered identity & access control**
- **Multi-factor auth**: agents report with mutual Token; the server uses an admin token plus an optional read-only token (minimal RBAC basis).
- **No more naked credentials**: dashboard login uses a signed `HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Strict` cookie, so the admin token is no longer stored in plaintext on the front end (kills the XSS-theft risk); optional **TOTP two-factor authentication** requires a code on top of the token for all admin writes, so the static token alone cannot perform dangerous actions.

**🌐 Cross-platform, drop-in**
- **Linux (Docker, stdlib-only) + Windows (native psutil) agents** report identical fields, so the server receives them with **zero changes**; the Windows agent can be registered as a "start on logon, restart on crash" scheduled task in one command.

**📊 Observability & alerting**
- Standard **Prometheus `/metrics`** export (Bearer auth) for Grafana; offline / CPU·memory threshold alerts push to **QQ Mail and Telegram** in parallel (one channel failing does not affect the other), with monthly-traffic-quota and expiry-countdown reminders.

**⚡ Lightweight, low-dependency, easy to deploy**
- Zero-dependency TOTP implementation; ECharts vendored locally (no CDN); agents are stdlib-only and run as non-root; application-layer rate limiting plus Nginx security headers; weak-token startup guard, input validation, and build-context isolation all included.

## Architecture

```
[Monitored VPS-A] docker agent ──HTTPS+Token──┐
[Monitored VPS-B] docker agent ──HTTPS+Token──┼──> [Dedicated VPS: server + dashboard]
[Monitored VPS-N] docker agent ──HTTPS+Token──┘      (Node + SQLite + ECharts / Nginx+TLS reverse proxy)
```

- **Agent is outbound-only**: reads metrics from `/proc` and POSTs them to `/api/report`. No firewall ports need to be opened on the monitored host; NAT / internal networks are unaffected.
- **Server**: binds `localhost:8080` and is exposed to the internet solely via Nginx + TLS on port 443.

## Security design

1. **Zero inbound on agents** — outbound reporting only.
2. **No remote exec / shell** — the agent only reads system metrics; there is no command-execution interface (the root cause of Nezha RCE).
3. **Authentication** — each agent has an `AGENT_ID` + `AGENT_TOKEN` (generated server-side, stored as sha256 in the DB); reports require `X-Agent-ID` + `Bearer`; unknown / mismatched are rejected.
4. **Transport encryption** — HTTPS throughout.
5. **Input validation** — `/api/report` strictly validates value ranges and types; out-of-range / malformed input is rejected with 400.
6. **Rate limiting** — Nginx rate-limits the report endpoint.
7. **Minimal attack surface** — local SQLite file; all dashboard / write endpoints require the admin token.
8. **Weak-token startup guard** — at startup, if `ADMIN_TOKEN` is empty, equals the default `change-me-admin-token`, or is shorter than 16 chars, the server refuses to start (`process.exit(1)`), forcing the admin to set a strong token early.
9. **HTTPS enforcement on admin APIs** — `adminAuth` checks `X-Forwarded-Proto`; any request proxied over a non-HTTPS origin is rejected with `403`, preventing plaintext transmission of the admin token. Note: this is fully effective only when the server port is NOT published to the public internet and only Nginx is exposed.
10. **Build-context isolation** — `server/.dockerignore` excludes `data/`, `.env`, `node_modules`, etc., so the SQLite database and credentials are never baked into the image.
11. **Dashboard two-factor authentication (TOTP)** — can be enabled in the "Security" panel. Once enabled, all **admin write operations** (create/edit/delete clients, reset token, test alert) additionally require a TOTP code on top of the static token, so the static admin token alone cannot perform dangerous actions. Dashboard login is maintained by a signed `HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Strict` cookie, so the admin token is **no longer stored in plaintext on the front end** (eliminating the XSS-theft risk). Read-only pulls (Grafana, `/metrics`, `READONLY_TOKEN`) stay transparent and are not subject to 2FA. See "Two-factor authentication (TOTP)" below.
12. **Agent report-channel hardening** — both agents (Linux / Windows) enforce HTTPS client-side: a non-localhost `http://` `SERVER_URL` fails at startup, preventing the token from ever being sent in cleartext (defense in depth beyond the server's `X-Forwarded-Proto` whitelist). On `401/403` they enter a **10-minute long backoff with no immediate retry** (the static token cannot self-heal, avoiding log flooding and brute-force against the server); transient errors (5xx, network blips) still use the exponential backoff retry.

### Two-factor authentication (TOTP)

To further harden the admin surface, enable TOTP 2FA in the dashboard's "🔒 Security" panel:

1. Open the Security panel and click **Enable two-factor authentication**; the system generates a Base32 secret (shown only once).
2. Manually enter the secret into any TOTP app (Google Authenticator / 1Password / Authy). This project calls no external QR service, complying with the CSP policy.
3. Enter the 6-digit code shown by the app and click **Confirm enable**.

After enabling:

- Dashboard login requires **admin token + TOTP code**; the session is kept via a signed cookie (HttpOnly, never stored in plaintext on the front end).
- All admin write operations require the TOTP code in addition to the token; the static token alone is rejected.
- Read-only monitoring (Grafana, `/metrics`, read-only token) is unaffected and stays transparent.

**Lost-device recovery**: if you lose your TOTP device, clear the 2FA config in SQLite and re-bind:

```bash
sqlite3 data/monitor.db "DELETE FROM admin_config;"
```

(In production, `SESSION_SECRET` should be a fixed random value; otherwise every server restart invalidates all sessions.)

## Threat model: trust-boundary analysis (design philosophy)

> In one sentence: **Trust isolation matters more than feature richness.** This project's security is achieved not by stacking defensive layers, but by *not doing* things — no command channel, no host fingerprinting, no agent-to-agent awareness. An attacker cannot exploit what does not exist.

### Our assumption: the server is untrusted, and so is the agent

Many monitoring systems implicitly assume "the server is trusted". Once the server is compromised, every agent falls with it — because agents accept server commands, execute pushed tasks, and trust everything the server says.

Our design assumes the opposite: **the server may be compromised, a single agent may be compromised, and either breach must not affect the other.** Below we verify this assumption against the code.

### Three pillars (all verified in code)

**① No command channel (Agent → Server is one-way)**
- The agent only `POST`s to `/api/report`; the response body is used solely for error logging (`e.read()`) and is **never parsed or executed**. The agent listens on no port and has no `subprocess`/`Popen`/`eval`/`exec`.
- The server's only agent-facing endpoint is `POST /report`; `agentAuth` merely validates the token and stores the metric, returning `{ok:true}`. There is no WebSocket / SSE / any downstream push in the codebase; the dashboard refreshes via browser-side polling, unrelated to agents.
- This is a **deliberate non-implementation** of a command channel — not "not yet built". Bidirectional WebSocket monitors are the opposite: more capable, but the trust boundary is broken.

**② Zero coupling between agents**
- Each agent knows only its own `SERVER_URL` + token, and is unaware of other agents.
- Metrics are stored per `agent_id`; all cross-agent aggregation (`getAgents`/`getMetricsAll`) is admin-only read queries for the dashboard, never pushed to any agent. Even a compromised server has no mechanism to make "agent A contact agent B".

**③ Collected data carries no exploitable information**
- We collect only basic state: online, load, CPU, memory, disk, traffic (incl. monthly totals), temperature, Swap, uptime. Temperature / Swap / uptime are **non-fingerprint** metrics (no kernel version / CVE targeting, no public IP, no GPU), so even a leak yields nothing actionable.
- We do **not** collect kernel version, GPU, public IP, connection count, or process count — fingerprints usable for targeted attack. Even if the server DB is exfiltrated, the leak is only "machine X had CPU/memory Y at time Z" — useless for targeted attacks (no kernel version → no CVE targeting, no public IP → no direct target, no GPU → no mining leverage).

### Three compromise scenarios

| Scenario | Attacker can | This project | Command-channel / fingerprinting monitor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ① Server compromised | Read reported data | ✅ (basic state incl. non-fingerprint metrics, no fingerprint) | ✅ (incl. kernel/GPU/public-IP/conns) |
| | Spoof data to mislead agents | no effect (agents take no commands) | no effect |
| | Push malicious tasks / probes | ❌ impossible (no command channel) | ✅ can push; agent becomes jump host |
| | Move laterally to other agents | ❌ impossible | ⚠️ can probe other networks via tasks |
| ② One agent compromised | Read its own token | ✅ (visible via docker env) | ✅ (visible via ps/cmdline) |
| | Spoof its own data | ✅ (only affects that agent) | ✅ |
| | Lateral move / attack server | ❌ impossible (POST-only; server runs no agent command) | ❌ impossible |
| ③ Server + one agent compromised | Get other agents' tokens | ⚠️ yes (see refinement) | ⚠️ yes |
| | Spoof other agents' data | ⚠️ yes | ⚠️ yes |
| | Execute / push tasks on other agents | ❌ impossible (no command channel) | ✅ possible (probe tasks, not RCE) |

### Refinement of scenario ③ (our design is more optimistic)

Tokens are stored in the database as **SHA-256 hashes** (`token_hash`), never in plaintext. Authentication compares `sha256(submitted token)` against the stored hash (constant-time). Therefore:

- A **read-only** DB leak (e.g. exfiltration without write access) yields **no plaintext token** for any agent. To spoof another agent's data, the attacker must either brute-force a 24-byte random token (infeasible) or overwrite `token_hash` with a known value.
- In other words, a "compromised server" that is read-only **cannot immediately spoof**; DB write access is required. This is a concrete hardening of the ⚠️ row above.

In the worst case (server + one agent both compromised), the attacker's ceiling is **spoofing other agents' reports** — the dashboard shows fake data, but **no machine is controlled**.

### Two honest caveats

1. **On the collected set**: besides the basic state, `hostname`, `os` (distro name, e.g. "Ubuntu 22.04"), temperature, Swap, and uptime are also stored. They are lightweight identifiers or **non-fingerprint metrics** (temperature / Swap / uptime carry no kernel version / CVE targeting, no public IP, no GPU), not attack fingerprints; the "no fingerprint" claim should be read as "no fingerprint useful for targeted attack".
2. **Token hashing downgrades "plaintext leak" to "forge only with DB write access"**, not complete immunity — this should be explicit when evaluating scenario ③.

## Trust-boundary comparison with mainstream monitors (e.g. Nezha)

Many monitors (e.g. Nezha) prioritize features with an architecture of **monitored hosts exposed to the public internet + bidirectional communication (WebSocket) + remote execution**. More capable, but the trust boundary is broken: once the server is compromised, every monitored host becomes a remotely controllable node.

| Dimension | Simple Probe (this project) | Command-channel monitors (e.g. Nezha) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent inbound | Zero inbound (outbound HTTPS only) | Usually exposes ports / dashboard to the internet |
| Communication | One-way (Agent→Server POST) | Bidirectional (WebSocket, server can push) |
| Remote execution | ❌ none (deliberately absent) | ✅ present (command exec → RCE risk) |
| Agent coupling | Zero; mutually unaware | Server can orchestrate; agents can be jump hosts |
| Collected data | Basic state (incl. non-fingerprint metrics like temp/Swap/uptime), no fingerprint | May include kernel/version/network detail |
| Worst case (server + 1 agent breached) | Only report spoofing; no machine controlled | Can push tasks to probe / execute via agents |
| Trust model | Server and agents both untrusted | Implicitly assumes "server is trusted" |

> Bottom line: Simple Probe trades a functional "subtraction" (no command channel, no fingerprinting, no agent awareness) for a security "addition". An attacker cannot exploit what does not exist.

## Clarification on other agent-type probes (source-level evidence)

Some other agent-type probes (an open-source project using a server→agent command channel), often compared with this project, also use that pattern. Two common misconceptions are corrected here with its actual `agent/main.go` source.

**Misconception 1: "the agent can be RCE'd" — false.**
Its ICMP probe path is: `executeICMPPing(target)` → `resolvePublicIPs()` (DNS resolution + blacklist check) → take `ips[0].String()` → only then `exec.Command("ping", "-c", "1", "-W", "2", pingTarget)`. Two facts matter:
- The argument reaching `exec.Command` is **always the output of `net.IP.String()`** (e.g. `192.168.1.1`, `2001:db8::1`) — it can never contain shell metacharacters like `;`, `|`, or backticks.
- Go's `exec.Command` calls `execve` directly; no `/bin/sh` is involved.

So even if the server pushes `; rm -rf /`, it is rejected at the `resolvePublicIPs` / `net.ParseIP` stage and ping never starts. **This is not RCE; it is a type-constrained command invocation.** Equating "there is an exec call" with "arbitrary code can be executed" is classic audit over-generalization. Its TCP/HTTP paths dial using the already-validated `net.IP` objects directly (`dialPublicTCP` → `dialResolvedTCP`), with no second DNS resolution, so there is no DNS-rebinding / TOCTOU bypass — its SSRF defense is actually quite rigorous.

**Misconception 2: "adding task signatures to the WebSocket fixes server-compromise risk" — ineffective for this threat model.**
This project's threat model assumes the server is untrusted and may be compromised. Once the server is compromised, the attacker holds the signing key and **is the legitimate signer**. Task signatures only protect against a third party tampering in transit; they cannot stop the server itself from being the attacker. For signatures to help here, a trust root outside the server (independent CA or agent-local allowlist) would be required — which is effectively redesigning the trust model, and that is exactly "no command channel" itself.

**Correct characterization & conclusion:**
- After a server compromise, the attacker **can** make all agents probe arbitrary public targets via ICMP/TCP/HTTP (restricted by the CIDR blacklist to public addresses only — no intranet reach). It is a **distributed probe jump host**, not an RCE botnet.
- But the "probe jump host" capability **is not a bug; it is the core feature** (public ping monitoring). It cannot be removed while keeping the feature; only eliminating the command channel (this project's approach) resolves it fully.

> In one line: such an agent-type probe is a *constrained controlled probe agent*, not an *RCE backdoor*. Its problem is not RCE — it is the mere existence of a command channel, which this project deliberately avoids.

## Why we deliberately do not implement these features

The core idea of this project is "security through omission." Below are common features in similar monitors that we deliberately leave out, each with its security rationale. Every omission corresponds to one of our trust-boundary guarantees.

### 1. Centralized active probing (ICMP / TCP / HTTP ping of arbitrary targets, assignable to specific nodes)
For an agent to ping or probe a target, the server must push a task to it — which requires a command channel. Once a command channel exists, the trust boundary breaks: a compromised server could make every agent probe arbitrary public targets, turning the fleet into a distributed probe jump host. We keep the Agent → Server flow strictly one-way, so we do not offer "server-orchestrated probing."

> **Addendum (2026-07-09): we added a safe equivalent — "agent-side network-quality self-test."** The idea is to replace "server pushes arbitrary probe targets" with "each agent pings / TCP-probes a few *fixed public infrastructures* hardcoded in its local config (default: three carrier DNS + 8.8.8.8) from its own host. Because the probe targets come from the agent's local config and the server **never** pushes any, the command channel does not exist and the trust boundary stays intact. See "Network-quality self-test (fixed public targets)" below. It honors the "don't do" principles: no fingerprint, no new command channel, zero agent coupling.

### 2. Host fingerprinting (kernel version / GPU model / public IP / TCP connection count, etc.)
Such fingerprints, if the server is breached (especially exfiltrated), directly expose each machine's attack surface — an old kernel version enables targeted CVE matching, a public IP gives a direct target, a GPU enables mining trade-offs. We collect only basic state (incl. non-fingerprint metrics such as temperature / Swap / uptime), so even a leak yields nothing actionable for targeted attack.

### 3. Server-pushed sampling interval / collection policy
This is another variant of a command channel (server influencing agent behavior). We fix sampling logic locally on the agent; the server neither pushes nor knows it, preserving the isolation that "a breach of either side cannot affect the other."

### 4. Using agents as jump hosts to probe third parties
A natural consequence of the above. With no command channel and no externally controllable command invocation, an agent can never be induced to contact an attacker-chosen target under any circumstance.

> Note: dashboards, metric history charts, node grouping, alerting on the existing metrics, multi-user access with TOTP, etc. are fully provided — they only read the basic-state data the agent already reports and rely on no downstream command, so they break none of the guarantees above. In one line: we trade the convenience of "letting the server command agents to do work" for the isolation that "a breach of either the server or any agent cannot spread to the other." An attacker cannot exploit what does not exist.

## Network-quality self-test (fixed public targets)

The agent actively pings / TCP-probes **public infrastructures hardcoded in its local config** (default: China Unicom / Telecom / Mobile DNS + 8.8.8.8) from its own host, reporting each target's round-trip latency and reachability to the server. It is the safe equivalent of the "centralized active probing" feature we refuse to implement:

- **Targets are hardcoded locally**: configured via the `PROBE_TARGETS` env var, format `label:host[:port]`, comma-separated; usable by default, empty to disable. The server **never** pushes any probe target to the agent — the fundamental divide from command-channel monitors.
- **No command channel**: the server cannot order any agent to probe an arbitrary host, so the fleet can never become a distributed probe jump host. The core pillars (no command channel / zero agent coupling / data minimization) are fully preserved.
- **Only latency and reachability**: each target reports only `ms` (round-trip ms, `null` if unreachable) and `ok` (boolean) — no host fingerprint of any kind.
- **ICMP first, TCP fallback**: prefers system `ping` (`-c 1`; works as non-root via `iputils-ping`'s `cap_net_raw`); if `ping` is unavailable or blocked, it falls back to a TCP handshake against the target port (default 53) — functional even without privileges. Targets are probed in parallel, adding only ~1–2s to each collection cycle.
- **Display**: client cards show a "network" line (e.g. `移动 18ms · 电信 23ms · 联通 ✕`); the detail page renders a multi-series ECharts time-series "network quality (latency to probe targets, ms)".

> Note: this capability tests *only* "this host → fixed public IP" network quality. It is entirely different from "letting the server orchestrate agents to probe arbitrary targets," which remains a feature we deliberately do not implement (see "Centralized active probing" above).

> Real-time traffic (live up/down rate) is a prime example of such a safe enhancement: the rate is computed locally on the agent from its own two samples (`net_rx_rate`/`net_tx_rate`), shipped through the existing report channel, and displayed by polling the frontend — no command channel added, no fingerprint collected. This project already ships a live rate readout in the agent detail view, refreshing every 3 seconds.

## Third-party dependencies & privacy
- **Zero external front-end requests**: ECharts is vendored locally at `server/public/vendor/echarts.min.js`; the dashboard loads no CDN scripts. The server sets a strict `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; ...` with **no `unsafe-inline`**; all front-end interactions use `addEventListener` event delegation, which closes the XSS path that could steal the admin token.
- **Mail dependency**: alerts use `nodemailer` v9 (QQ Mail SMTP). After a major-version upgrade the transport is validated via `transporter.verify()`; just configure a real `SMTP_PASS` at deploy time.

## Deployment

### A. Server (your dedicated VPS)

```bash
# 1) Prepare the environment
apt update && apt install -y docker.io docker-compose nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx

# 2) Copy server/ to the VPS and configure environment variables
cd server
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set ADMIN_TOKEN, SMTP_PASS (QQ Mail authorization code), etc.
# NOTE: ADMIN_TOKEN must not be empty, must not equal the example default,
#       and must be >= 16 chars, otherwise the server refuses to start.

# 3) Start
docker compose up -d        # binds 127.0.0.1:8080 only (loopback); data in volume /data

# 4) Obtain TLS and set up the reverse proxy (see nginx/monitor.conf.example)
cp nginx/monitor.conf.example /etc/nginx/conf.d/monitor.conf
nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx
# then let certbot add 443 + cert (includes /api/report rate limiting):
certbot --nginx -d monitor.yourdomain.com
```

> **aaPanel (宝塔) users**: do not hand-write a conf that fights aaPanel. In aaPanel, create a site → reverse proxy pointing the domain to `127.0.0.1:8080`, and use aaPanel's Let's Encrypt one-click for TLS. Put the rate-limit zone (`limit_req_zone`) in "Nginx management → config" (the http block), and only keep `limit_req` in the site config.
> If Nginx itself is a separate Docker container (not a host process), put server and Nginx on a shared Docker network, reach each other by service name, and remove the `127.0.0.1:` port mapping in `server/docker-compose.yml`.

### Hide the origin IP (optional, recommended)

Even without Cloudflare's CDN/WAF ("CF shield"), the setup above (8080 bound to loopback + Nginx TLS + strong token + CSP) is already secure; however, the VPS public IP is still directly exposed and will be scanned / brute-forced, with no managed WAF.

To **expose no inbound ports at all** and keep the origin IP invisible, see [`TUNNEL-GUIDE.md`](TUNNEL-GUIDE.md): it covers both Cloudflare Tunnel and Tailscale, with full commands and certificate / firewall notes.

### B. Monitored side (each monitored VPS)

1. Open the dashboard → enter the admin token top-right → click **"+ New client"** → you get an `AGENT_ID` and an `AGENT_TOKEN`.
2. On that VPS, run:

```bash
docker run -d --name monitor-agent --restart unless-stopped \
  --network host \
  -e SERVER_URL=https://monitor.yourdomain.com \
  -e AGENT_ID=<the id you got> \
  -e AGENT_TOKEN=<the token you got> \
  -e INTERVAL=15 \
  -e DISK_PATH=/host \
  -v /:/host:ro \
  -v monitor-agent-data:/data \
  host-monitor-agent:latest
```

> **Key parameters for accurate host metrics**:
> - `--network host`: shares the host network namespace so `/proc/net/dev` reflects real traffic (the default bridge network would show the container's view).
> - `-v /:/host:ro` + `-e DISK_PATH=/host`: read-only mount of the host root so disk usage is computed for the VPS root disk, not the container overlay.
> - If running the agent directly on bare metal (no Docker), keep `DISK_PATH` at its default `/`.

> The `host-monitor-agent` image must be built on the monitored host first: `cd agent/ && docker build -t host-monitor-agent .`, or push it to a private/public registry and `docker pull`.

3. The client card appears on the dashboard, live-refreshing CPU/memory/disk/traffic/load, and you can edit **merchant, note, expiry date, monthly traffic quota**.

## Quick start (one-click)

A root `docker-compose.yml` is provided for a fast single-command launch of the **server** (dashboard) for testing / demos:

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env   # then edit ADMIN_TOKEN etc.
docker compose up -d                 # serves on http://<host>:8080
```

> ⚠️ This quick start exposes the server on plaintext `:8080`. The admin token would travel unencrypted, so **do not use it for production**. For production, always put Nginx + TLS in front (see section A above).

## Environment variables

**Server `.env`**: `PORT`, `ADMIN_TOKEN`, `OFFLINE_THRESHOLD_SEC` (default 60), `RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30), `ALERT_CPU_PCT`/`ALERT_MEM_PCT` (default 90), `ALERT_COOLDOWN_SEC`, `SMTP_*` (QQ Mail alerts), `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`/`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` (optional, Telegram alerts), `READONLY_TOKEN` (optional, read-only account — see below), `SESSION_SECRET`/`SESSION_TTL_MS` (2FA session — see "Two-factor authentication (TOTP)").

**Monitored side**: `SERVER_URL`, `AGENT_ID`, `AGENT_TOKEN`, `INTERVAL` (seconds, default 15), `DISK_PATH` (default `/`), `PROBE_TARGETS` (network-quality self-test targets; default `移动:211.136.192.6,电信:101.226.4.6,联通:202.106.0.20,公共:8.8.8.8`; empty to disable; format `label:host[:port]`, comma-separated).

## Dashboard features

- Overview: total / online / offline / average CPU·memory.
- Client cards: status dot, merchant badge, CPU/memory/load/traffic mini sparklines, disk progress bar, **expiry countdown** (<7 days yellow, expired red), notes.
- Detail page: ECharts time-series for CPU, memory, load, network rate, disk, temperature, Swap, network quality (latency to fixed public probe targets), and this-month traffic (vs quota), over 1h/6h/24h/7d.
- Edit / delete clients; auto-refresh every 10s.

## Alerts

- Offline (no report for longer than `OFFLINE_THRESHOLD_SEC`), CPU/memory over threshold → pushed via QQ Mail, with cooldown de-duplication (recipient configured via `ALERT_TO` in `.env`).
- **Prune-failure alert**: if `prune` fails 3 times in a row (e.g. DB permission / disk issues), an email alert is sent so the metrics table does not silently grow without bound.
- **Telegram alerts (optional)**: once `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are set in `.env`, the alerts above are **also** delivered to Telegram in parallel with email (each channel fails independently). See `.env.example` for how to obtain them.
- Provide `SMTP_PASS` in `.env` for mail (QQ Mail: Settings → Account → generate authorization code; not the login password). Telegram and email can be enabled independently.
- **Send a test alert**: after configuring, verify with `curl -X POST -H 'X-Admin-Token: YOUR_TOKEN' http://localhost:8080/api/test-alert` (add `-H 'X-Forwarded-Proto: https'` when behind an Nginx proxy), click the **📨 Test Alert** button on the dashboard top-right (fill in the admin token first), or run `node scripts/test-notify.js` from the `server/` directory.

## Read-only account (READONLY_TOKEN)

To avoid sharing the full-privilege admin token around, configure an optional **read-only** account:

- Set the optional `READONLY_TOKEN` in `.env` (also recommended ≥ 16 chars).
- Holders may **only call read-only `GET` endpoints** (client list, latest metrics, sparklines, `/metrics`); all write operations (`POST /agents`, `PUT/DELETE /agents/:id`, `reset-token`, `/test-alert`) are blocked by the `adminOnly` guard with `401`.
- Ideal for read-only consumers like Grafana / third-party dashboards, so the admin token is not exposed to them.
- The read-only account is **not subject to 2FA** (2FA only constrains admin writes), keeping programmatic read pulls transparent.

## Prometheus metrics export (`/metrics`)

To integrate with Prometheus / Grafana and other observability stacks, the server exposes metrics in standard exposition format:

- `GET /metrics` returns Prometheus text format with unit-suffixed metric names and escaped labels, e.g. `probe_cpu_percent{agent="...",host="..."}`, `probe_mem_percent`, `probe_disk_percent`, `probe_net_rx_bytes_per_sec`, etc.
- **Auth**: supports `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN | READONLY_TOKEN>`; requests without a token get `401`.
- **Trade-off**: this endpoint does **not** enforce HTTPS, to ease in-network Prometheus scraping, protected by the Bearer token; if exposed publicly, always place it behind Nginx + TLS.
- Example:

```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your READONLY_TOKEN>' http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

## Windows monitored side

Besides the Linux Docker agent, this project ships a **native Windows agent** (see the `agent/windows/` directory) for monitoring Windows servers:

- Built on `psutil`, it collects CPU / memory / disk / network rate & monthly totals / uptime, and reports **exactly the same fields as the Linux agent**, so the server receives it with zero changes.
- Windows has no load average, so `load1/load5/load15` are fixed placeholders `0.0` (the dashboard shows 0, as expected).
- Install: run `agent/windows/install.ps1` to auto `pip install psutil` and register a "start on logon, restart on crash" scheduled task (auto-start); `run.bat` offers a convenient temporary launcher. See `agent/windows/README.md` for details.
- Security follows the main project: the agent is outbound-only with no remote-execution interface, using `HTTPS + Token` end to end; monthly traffic totals persist to `state.json` and survive restarts.

## Security review checklist

A security review was performed; all high/medium items are addressed. Summary (✅ done, ⬜ optional left):

| Priority | Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Critical fixes (S1/S2) | ✅ | Fixed in earlier session |
| P1 | Hardening (S5/C5/C4) | ✅ | Fixed in earlier session |
| P2 | Hardening (④⑤⑥⑦) | ✅ | Fixed in earlier session |
| P3 ⑩ | Prometheus `/metrics` | ✅ | `GET /metrics` with Bearer / read-only token auth |
| P3 ⑪ | Read-only account (RBAC basis) | ✅ | `READONLY_TOKEN`: read-only GET, no writes |
| P3 ⑨ | Windows agent | ✅ | `agent/windows/` on psutil, protocol-compatible with Linux, zero server changes |
| P3 ⑧ | Admin TOTP 2FA | ✅ | Signed session-cookie login (no plaintext token on front end) + TOTP on writes |
| P3 ⑧ | WebAuthn / hardware key | ⬜ | Optional left: TOTP already removes the plaintext-token exposure; WebAuthn adds limited value and needs browser + third-party lib verification |

**Bottom line**: the review's concern — a static admin token lingering in the front end and stealable via XSS — is fully resolved by the **HttpOnly signed-cookie login + TOTP second factor**; cross-platform agents, metric exposure, and the read-only account are all in place.
